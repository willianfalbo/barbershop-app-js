# LIBRARIES AND FRAMEWORKS

## Sucrase (https://sucrase.io/)
In order to run the latest features of ES5+, we are using Sucrase instead of Babel (https://babeljs.io).
It was needed to add `nodemon.json` file in the root folder.
NOTE: Sucrase will never produce code for old browsers like IE. Compiling code down to ES5 is much more complicated than any transformation that Sucrase needs to do.
